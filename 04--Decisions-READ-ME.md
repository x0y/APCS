In my Sound.java file, I have match.wav, mismatch.wav, and win.wav defined for my sounds. Of course, these can be replaced for your own sounds (just name your files as such). However, if you'd like to use mine (which I created myself using Garageband), use the following links to download them and add them to your tileGame folder:
